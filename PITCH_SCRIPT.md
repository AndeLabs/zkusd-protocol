# zkUSD - Winning Pitch Script

---

## THE HOOK (First 30 seconds - Make them CARE)

> **"Hi, I'm Omar.**
>
> **Imagine you have Bitcoin. You believe in it. You've held it for years.**
>
> **Then life happens. You need money. Maybe it's an emergency. Maybe it's an opportunity.**
>
> **But to get that money... you have to sell your Bitcoin.**
>
> **And the moment you sell... you're out. You lose everything you believed in.**
>
> **This is the reality for every Bitcoin holder today.**
>
> **And that's why I built zkUSD."**

---

## THE PROBLEM (Make them FEEL it)

> **"Today, if you need liquidity from your Bitcoin, you have two choices:**
>
> **You can sell. But selling means taxes, losing your position, and watching Bitcoin go up without you.**
>
> **Or you can use a bridge. Send your Bitcoin to another chain. But bridges get hacked. People lose everything. We've seen it happen again and again.**
>
> **So what do most Bitcoiners do?**
>
> **Nothing. They just hold. They watch opportunities pass by. Because the risk is too high.**
>
> **I thought... there has to be a better way."**

---

## THE SOLUTION (Simple and clear)

> **"zkUSD is that better way.**
>
> **It's a stablecoin that lives directly on Bitcoin.**
>
> **You deposit your Bitcoin as collateral. You get dollars. Your Bitcoin never moves. It stays on Bitcoin. In your control.**
>
> **No bridges. No companies holding your keys. No trust required.**
>
> **Just you, your Bitcoin, and math."**

---

## WHY IT'S DIFFERENT (The "Aha" moment)

> **"Every other solution asks you to trust someone.**
>
> **WBTC? You trust a company with your keys.**
>
> **Sidechains? You trust a group of signers.**
>
> **zkUSD is different.**
>
> **We use Zero-Knowledge proofs. Your computer proves that everything is correct. The blockchain verifies the math. No humans in the middle.**
>
> **You don't trust people. You trust mathematics.**
>
> **And math doesn't lie."**

---

## WHAT WE BUILT (Show the work)

> **"This isn't just an idea. We built it.**
>
> **Four smart contracts. Running on Bitcoin. Right now.**
>
> *[Show mempool.space]*
>
> **This is our Stability Pool contract. Confirmed on Bitcoin. You can see it.**
>
> **This is our Vault Manager. The core of the system. Live on the blockchain.**
>
> *[Show web app]*
>
> **And this is our web app. Connect a wallet. Open a vault. Get stablecoins.**
>
> **We built a complete DeFi system on Bitcoin. In weeks. From scratch."**

---

## THE INNOVATION (Technical credibility)

> **"We didn't just port Ethereum code. We reimagined it for Bitcoin.**
>
> **Client-side validation. Your vault is private. Only you see it.**
>
> **UTXO-based flash minting. The attacks that cost millions on Ethereum? Impossible here. By design.**
>
> **And we used the Liquity model. Battle-tested. Billions processed. Zero hacks.**
>
> **The safest DeFi model, on the safest blockchain."**

---

## THE CLOSE (Memorable)

> **"Bitcoin holders have waited years for this.**
>
> **A way to use their Bitcoin without giving it up. Without trusting strangers. Without taking risks.**
>
> **zkUSD makes that possible.**
>
> **Unlock your Bitcoin... without leaving Bitcoin.**
>
> **Trust math. Not validators.**
>
> **Thank you."**

# 3-Minute Pitch (Demo Day Version)

**Target: Encode Hackathon - Best Idea using Charms ($15K Prize Pool)**

## Structure (Aligned to Judging Criteria)

### 1. HOOK + PROBLEM (30 seconds)
> "Hi, I'm Omar.
>
> Imagine you own Bitcoin. You've held it for years. Then life happens - you need money.
>
> Your options today? Sell and lose your position. Or use a bridge... and risk losing everything.
>
> Most Bitcoiners just hold. They watch opportunities pass. Because every option is too risky."

*[Hits: USE CASE - Does it solve a problem that matters?]*

### 2. SOLUTION (30 seconds)
> "zkUSD changes that.
>
> It's a stablecoin that lives directly on Bitcoin. You deposit BTC as collateral. You get dollars. Your Bitcoin never moves.
>
> No bridges. No custodians. Just you, your Bitcoin, and math."

*[Hits: USE CASE + POTENTIAL]*

### 3. HOW IT WORKS - CHARMS (45 seconds)
> "We built this with Charms Protocol.
>
> Your wallet executes the smart contract locally. It generates a Zero-Knowledge proof. The blockchain only verifies the math.
>
> No one sees your vault details. No one holds your keys. Client-side validation means privacy by default.
>
> And our UTXO design makes flash loan attacks - the ones that cost millions on Ethereum - mathematically impossible on Bitcoin."

*[Hits: IMPLEMENTATION - How well does it use Charms Protocol?]*

### 4. DEMO (45 seconds)
> *[Show mempool.space]*
> "These are our contracts. Live on Bitcoin testnet. Confirmed on the blockchain.
>
> *[Show web app]*
> This is our web app. Connect a wallet. Enter your collateral. Get zkUSD.
>
> Four smart contracts. Complete DeFi system. Built in weeks."

*[Hits: FUNCTIONALITY - Does it work?]*

### 5. CLOSE (30 seconds)
> "Bitcoin holders have waited years for this. A way to use their Bitcoin without giving it up.
>
> zkUSD makes that possible.
>
> We're using battle-tested economics from Liquity - billions processed, zero hacks - now on the most secure blockchain.
>
> Unlock your Bitcoin... without leaving Bitcoin.
>
> Trust math. Not validators.
>
> Thank you."

*[Hits: POTENTIAL - Could this become a real product?]*

# Quick Practice Version (Under 3 minutes)

**HOOK:** "Imagine you have Bitcoin and need money. Today, you have to sell it or risk a bridge hack. I built zkUSD to change that."

**PROBLEM:** "Bitcoiners do nothing with their BTC because every option is too risky."

**SOLUTION:** "zkUSD lets you borrow against Bitcoin without moving it. No bridges. No custodians. Just math."

**DIFFERENT:** "Others ask you to trust companies or signers. We use Zero-Knowledge proofs. Trust mathematics, not people."

**BUILT:** "Four contracts on Bitcoin. Working web app. You can try it today."

**CLOSE:** "Unlock your Bitcoin without leaving Bitcoin. Trust math. Not validators."

# Delivery Tips

**Voice:**
- Speak slowly at emotional moments
- Speed up slightly when showing excitement about what you built
- Pause after "Math doesn't lie" - let it sink in

**Body:**
- Look at the audience, not the screen
- When showing the demo, point at specific things
- End looking directly at the judges

**Energy:**
- Start calm and personal (the story)
- Build energy as you show the solution
- Peak energy when showing what you built
- Calm confidence for the close

# Q&A Prep

**"How does the price oracle work?"**
> "Same model as Liquity. Multiple sources. Time-weighted. Battle-tested."

**"What if Charms protocol fails?"**
> "Your BTC stays in your wallet. Worst case, you just have normal Bitcoin."

**"When mainnet?"**
> "After audit. We're building for real users."

**"Why should we believe this works?"**
> "Don't believe me. Look at the blockchain. The contracts are there. The proofs verify."

# Pre-Recorded Demo (45 seconds)

**Rebecca's advice: Pre-record demo to avoid technical difficulties**

### Recording Script:

**Scene 1: Mempool (15 sec)**
- Open mempool.space/testnet4
- Show StabilityPool TX (confirmed)
- Show VaultManager TX (confirmed)
- Voice: "These are our smart contracts. Live on Bitcoin. Confirmed on the blockchain."

**Scene 2: Web App (30 sec)**
- Open localhost:3000
- Show the interface
- Click "Open Vault"
- Enter collateral amount
- Enter debt amount
- Show the collateralization ratio
- Voice: "Connect wallet. Enter your collateral. Set your debt. The app calculates your ratio - you need at least 110% collateralization. Click to open vault. The ZK proof generates client-side. Your transaction goes to Bitcoin. You receive zkUSD."

### Demo Tips:
- Use screen recording (QuickTime or OBS)
- Zoom in on important areas
- Speak slowly and clearly
- Keep transitions smooth
- Test audio levels before recording
